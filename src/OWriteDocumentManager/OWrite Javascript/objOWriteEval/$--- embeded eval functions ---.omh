;  --- the following functions may have been embeded as calculations in our example OWrite documents ---

;  $nextrecord
;       ;; called by the next link in the Calculated Fields document
;       ;; load the next client record and evaluate the loaded document

;  $previousrecord
;       ;; called by the previous link in the Calculated Fields document
;       ;; load the next client record and evaluate the loaded document

;  $eval
;       ;; some example OWrite calculated fields call this method to evaluate fields by name instead of refering to database fields directly
;       ;; this potentially provides additional levels of control, i.e. parameters for formatting results could be added to this call

;  $evalList
;       ;; the "Tables - Picture" example document's table field calculation calls this method with information about
;       ;; what data to load into a list befor returning the list to OWrite
;       ;; Note: owrite table lists are stored in $ctask.OWRITE_TMP_VAR while the table is evaluated

;  $evalListTotal
;       ;; executes the Omnis totc function against the specified list column
;       ;; Note: owrite table lists are stored in $ctask.OWRITE_TMP_VAR while the table is evaluated

;  $openurl
;       ;; used with clickable OWrite calculated fields to open web pages
;       ;; NOTE: This function must be implemented by the remote form or desktop window as different actions are required

;  $opendocument
;       ;; used with clickable OWrite calculated fields to open OWrite documents
;       ;; NOTE: This function must be implemented by the remote form or desktop window as different actions are required
